# ﻿The Open Organization Maturity Model

## About this document

The Open Organization Maturity Model is a framework for helping your organization to become more transparent, inclusive, adaptable, collaborative, and communal. It outlines steps that individuals, teams, and organizations can take to critically examine their organizational practices and chart their progress toward becoming a more open organization (as outlined in [the Open Organization Definition](https://github.com/open-organization-ambassadors/open-org-definition/blob/master/open_org_definition.md)).

All organizations are different, so they adopt open principles and practices to different degrees. This model's three-level design therefore aims both to assist organizations determining the relative degree to which they act openly—and to help them explore possibilities for becoming more so.

## Transparency

In organizations that aren't open, transparency is rare. Individuals and teams do not regularly disclose their plans, products, or processes to multiple stakeholders. People affected by decisions are often surprised to learn about those decisions, and decision-makers often withhold data and resources without explanation. Locating and accessing potentially helpful resources can be difficult, in part because individuals and teams neither contribute to nor draw upon a shared repository of knowledge.

### Level 1

- Individuals and teams release project materials for review internally, after they've finished their work

- People recognize that leaders are making decisions that affect them but don't see a clear or obvious way of providing input on those decisions

- Materials that are part of decision-making practices become available for review after decisions are finalized

- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories about successes, but not about failures

- Individuals and teams share resources but in disconnected, fragmented, or individualized/siloed systems or repositories

- Individuals and teams release data and resources to others, but there is no commonly expressed or shared understanding of the criteria used to determine whether information is sensitive or not, and little context for understanding how decisions are made

### Level 2

- Individuals and teams make project-related and non-sensitive materials accessible to all members of project teams according to clearly defined and shared formats and/or protocols

- People feel like they know about—and are helping to shape—most, but not all, important decisions as those decisions are unfolding

- Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available at defined project milestones

- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories of successes _and_ failures during retrospectives and reviews

- The organization sponsors and promotes a shared repository for collective knowledge, and some organization members can and do contribute to it

- Individuals and teams withhold sensitive data and resources, and are somewhat clear about what they're not sharing, and provide some context but of limited scope

### Level 3

- Individuals and teams make project-related and non-sensitive materials broadly accessible to the organization—and possibly outside the organization as well—according to clearly defined and shared formats and/or protocols

- People feel like they are a part of an implemented a shared and standard process for collective decision-making, endorsed by the organization

- Materials that are part of decision-making practices are available for review at the beginning of projects, and are easily and continuously accessible during work processes

- Individuals and teams are comfortable sharing stories of successes _and_ failures, and frequently engage in difficult conversations during project execution

- The organization sponsors and promotes a robust and easily-accessible knowledge commons, and all teams and organization members make generous and unrestricted use of it

- Individuals and teams withhold sensitive data and resources, and are clear about what they're not sharing such that others understand why those materials are not available to them

## Inclusivity

In organizations that aren't open, people lack established channels for providing feedback or learning about projects and activities. Leaders and project teams do not actively solicit diverse perspectives in their work or think broadly about involving stakeholders of different backgrounds. People do not expect decision making to be an inclusive activity, so the organization does not actively promote a process for collective or collaborative decision-making. Instead, leaders make decisions without much input from others, and people are accustomed to receiving direction without any opportunity to provide input.

### Level 1

- Organization is working to establish guidelines and channels for encouraging diverse points of view by inviting opinions and participation from anyone who is interested in providing them

- Organization's procedures for participating in collective decision-making are the result of collaboration and agreement among various stakeholders

- Leaders are open to receiving feedback and creating an environment where people feel safe providing it

- Leaders maintain at least one clear and direct channel for receiving feedback from others, who feel comfortable using it

- When people share materials, they do so via private channels or discussions

- Organization encourages leaders to be conscious of voices not present in dialog and to actively seek them out for inclusion

### Level 2

- Guidelines for sharing and soliciting diverse points of view on company or departmental decisions are published for anyone to see

- People create materials on organizationally-sanctioned platforms that are accessible to others by default

- Organization can demonstrate that protocols and procedures for participating in organization-wide discussions are the result of collaborative efforts between cross-functional groups with representatives from different functional and geographic teams

- Leaders consistently demonstrate willingness to address and respond to feedback they've received, typically in a way that entire teams can see

- Leaders establish multiple channels and methods for feedback, use those channels themselves, and openly encourage others to use them

- Leaders routinely encourage all team members to participate in decision-making practices, and they expressly solicit such participation from parties that may be reluctant to do so

### Level 3

- Guidelines for sharing and soliciting diverse points of view on company or departmental decisions are published for anyone to see, and a cross-functional team of organizational members helps maintain them

- Organization advances clear guidelines for participants' use of collaborative platforms, and encourages the use of open technical standards in their work

- Leaders establish multiple channels and methods for feedback, each of which is aligned with people's preferences for providing it; leaders are reflexive about their attitudes toward feedback and open the feedback processes themselves to feedback from others

- Members feel empowered and enabled to share opinions constructively on any matter relevant to their work or about which they feel passionate

- Leaders maintain team-facing or public-facing records of the feedback they've received and/or the actions they've taken to address this feedback

- Organization assists leaders with specific resources (training programs, access to content, etc.) as they work to hone their strategies for forming inclusive teams

## Adaptability

In organizations that aren't open, responding to environmental conditions is difficult because centralized systems inhibit responsiveness and flexibility. Decision-making cannot keep pace with complex and shifting contexts. Information flows in predefined, linear, and often hierarchical directions, and power is centralized. As a result, people have difficulty sharing materials and providing valuable responses that could rapidly improve projects. They lack opportunities for empowerment, continuous learning, and the ability to engage in the kind of collective problem solving that produces innovative, nuanced solutions. People are afraid to fail because the organization discourages experimentation.

### Level 1

- People share materials, but typically in a one-way, "read only" fashion

- Organization routinely solicits feedback, but only from internal stakeholders

- Organization provides opportunities for members to learn about other aspects of the organization

- Members feel like they somewhat understand the organization's goals, but they might still have questions and are unsure where to find answers

- Organization encourages participants to solve problems by working together, but doesn't provide clear frameworks or guideance to ensure it happens

- Failure is a frequent topic of discussion among team members, but dicussions of failure often involve blame

### Level 2

- People share materials via methods that allow other members to modify those materials

- Organization promotes an obvious and accessible method for gathering feedback from both internal stakeholders and external parties

- Organization promotes continuous learning by offering programs and events

- Members regularly discuss their progress on projects, key metrics and performance indicators, and their roles in the organization's goals and strategies

- Organization promotes a structured process for collective decision-making and members use it regularly

- Members understand that failure is an acceptable outcome of experimentation, and they create processes to regularly discuss failure and continously improve

### Level 3

- Organization shares materials with external parties via methods that permit modification

- Organization expressly allocates resources for collecting, managing, and acting on feedback from external parties and/or stakeholders

- Organization provides clear, structured process and/or platform that members can use to locate collaborative efforts they might join—to learn more about and/or participate in a particular organizational function

- Leaders create environments where participants feel comfortable addressing challenges without managerial oversight

- Organization's decision-making processes are collectively modifiable, and members feel comfortable adjusting their behaviors in response to changing conditions

- Leaders cultivate a spirit of experimentation by spotlighting productive failures across the organization, and talk about their own failures as learning experiences

## Collaboration

In organizations that aren't open, people tend to share the work they do only when asked for it. Conversations and joint efforts across departmental boundaries are difficult, even discouraged. As a result, projects move more slowly than they otherwise could. Work gets duplicated unnecessarily across teams working toward similar goals, and project outcomes do not reflect the best possible results. People are not aware of the ways that work from other groups can enhance their own efforts, and they tend to let predetermined descriptions of their responsibilities dictate the work they do.

### Level 1

- People share work after they initiate or complete it

- Cross-functional teams exist but team roles are often unclear and governance structures are vague

- Outcomes of collaboration remain within the team, and team shares them only when asked for them

- Working groups and cross-functional teams often include the same faces and skill sets

- Teams infrequently revisit the outcomes of their collaborations

- People and teams collaborate but frequently say it's "too difficult" or "more trouble than it's worth"

### Level 2

- People initiate projects as groups

- Cross-functional teams exist and teams post roles and goals publicly

- Outcomes of collaboration are available to the entire organization, and team makes them available by default

- Teams are always seeking a diverse set of viewpoints, experiences, and skills

- Outcomes of collaboration are the subject of future debate and revision

- People and teams actively seek opportunities to collaborate as a built-in or natural part of their planning

### Level 3

- People working in groups effectively connect with additional project groups to form cross-functional teams

- Cross-functional teams exist and organizational promotes best practices for working together

- Outcomes of collaboration are available outside the organization

- Teams effectively leverage members' diverse views and skills

- Outcomes of collaboration see uptake, use, and/or modification outside the organization

## Community

In organizations that aren't open, people tend to act primarily in the service of individual and team goals. Because people don't often share their work and may use different languages to interpret the organization's mission, teams often have difficulty aligning their work with a common purpose. As a result, duplicate work becomes common and stakeholder buy-in decreases (because people can't always determine who those stakeholders are). Consequently, people may begin to feel disassociated with the organization as a whole, leading to attrition.

### Level 1

- Some members of the organization unite to define values and principles, but are not clearly supported when they do

- People feel welcome to participate in and contribute to the organization, and people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of retribution

- People understand that the best ideas win, and leadership responsibilities accrue to people with histories of contribution and commitment

- A common language for the organization emerges

### Level 2

- Documents expressing shared visions and agreements—like mission statements and codes of conduct—are easily accessible, and people reference them often

- Onboarding materials and orientation rituals provide adequate context for helping new members understand how the organization will benefit from their contributions

- Leaders demonstrate dedication to the organization's shared values, and they model the behavior the organization has determined admirable when they help resolve conflicts or other issues

- People make an effort to explain jargon, acronyms, and inside jokes to new members of the organization

### Level 3

- Shared values and principles inform decision-making, conflict resolution, and assessment processes

- People demonstrate shared consciousness and empowered execution; they feel a sense of agency and responsibility to the community

- Leaders understand that they grow by helping others grow, and they mentor junior members of the organization

- People collect and share stories that emerge from the community in order to articulate its identity, attract new members, grow, and provide mentorship
